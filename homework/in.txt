Betty Botter bought some butter but, said she, the butter's bitter. If I put it in my batter, it will make my batter bitter. But a bit of better butter will make my bitter batter better. 
So she bought some better butter, better than the bitter butter, put it in her bitter batter, made her bitter batter better. So it was better Betty Botter bought some better butter.
